 1) To serve html files. If the GET request refers to a correct filename
  then the content of the file is delivered.
 2) If the request provides an incorrect filename string, server responds
  with an error. This changes the response status and the html message body.
 3) Served html files outputs proper information for the tags
  <cs371date> and <3cs71server>
